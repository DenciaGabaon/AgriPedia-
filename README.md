# Agripedia

## Overview
The development of AgriPedia would be helpful for amateur gardeners, particularly for those who want to start a little DIY farm but have no background knowledge about growing one. AgriPedia will provide a platform for amateur gardeners to provide comprehensive information about the cultivation process of common Filipino vegetables, this includes planting techniques, pest and disease management practices, and harvesting guidelines. AgriPedia will also help promote home gardening which will encourage more individuals to engage in home gardening activities that will contribute to enhancing food security by providing access to fresh, nutritious produce.


## Application Development

The mobile application development stage is designed to provide farmers with detailed information and updates regarding the crops they are managing. All data presented in the application originates from the cloud database. Sensors measuring soil, temperature, and humidity collect data, which is then transmitted to the nodeMCU microcontroller. In order to link it to the cloud database, the communication module to be utilised is Wi-Fi. Thresholds are established within the microcontroller to trigger alerts based on the current data, notifying users for decision-making purposes. In the analysis phase, the system employs a fuzzy logic algorithm. The crop health indicators for users are based on the fuzzy logic algorithm, through this algorithm the system would be able to determine if the current condition of the crop is ideal or not for its growth.
